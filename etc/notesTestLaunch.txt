create a new file
extend launchable

def launchId different from otehrs

def launch (you already have sc)
arguments : local 10 etc...

for ex,
try different number of slices
(see the SliceTrial)

then add the new launcher in launchmap
do what you want

for quicker things use keywordLaunch and even better SLRLaunchable

go to matlab and use loadjson(file)
