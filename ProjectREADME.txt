All of our code and explanatory files can be found at:

There is a link to download the paper (also on bspace), as well as links to view source code and download source code.

Please email jackdreilly@berkeley.edu if this is not preferable.

Our code was in scala/python/bash/ec2 rsync/matlab/etc..... so it was not easy to follow the explicit instructions pertaining ease of reproducibility, but all code is on website and can be built and deployed.
